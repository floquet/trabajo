#  Module that runs profile fitting to derives B0, B1 
#  and saves the results in RIPE/ROAM - input format
  
## Method to format output according to format convention
#
#  @param[in] - fmt: format specifier
#  @param[in] - value: output value

## Main method that calls ReadSao and FitProfile and saves parameters
#
#  @param - string - the full output file name
#
#  @return - list of string - list of full file name that has been translated
