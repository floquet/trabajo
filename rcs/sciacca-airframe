Size of the Sciacca AirFrame

Fuselage length (x): 44.5 m
Wingspan        (y): 41.8 m
Height          (z):  6.096 m

The height is the same as the fuselage diameter.

Details:
The CAD model maintains a list of dimensionless vertex points which are passed to CAD with a declaration of units.

Here is the command to interrogate the list of all 345 points:
extents = (Max[#] - Min[#]) & /@ {x, y, z}
{44500., 41800., 6096.}

The file PTW.geo contains the unit specifications. In line 78 we find "mm"

In response to a previous interchange, note that Joe leaves the radar frequency units in GHz (lines 54-44):
