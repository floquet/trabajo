Nelson:

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this morning. My plan was to talk you through the presentation sitting in your inbox,
but you had already scanned and digested the contents. The slide deck served as a springboard for a beneficial discussion.
The primary points are

Priorities for the short term:
1. Elevation data. 0-45° in 5° increments.
2. You want to see a ship.

After that: scaling exercises. Double the Sciacca airframe. Scale the ship through destroyer, frigate, and, littoral classes.

The "OTH 101" talk was quite helpful. That would make a singularly useful slide deck!

A general tone was how a solid mathematical foundation supports sound engineering decisions, and the goal
is to make tradeoffs to advance the Dashboard. You discussed how constraints like radar operation, radar return,
external data sources, ionospheric variability, and model fidelity deny definitive characterization of the problem.
You tied this in to how the RCS exercise addresses your "need to get a feel for how this would be implemented."
A synergistic success was realized from you nominating truncation criteria which were then evaluated using basic mathematical tools.

General guidance:

• You don't want to be killed in a data avalanche. Keep results concise.

• Keep assembling results and documentation on process. We will use it later.

Information:

• Some alphabetic agency will be providing RCS data based on radar measurements of copper miniatures. The data will be decomposed
    into elevation and azimuth (pitch and yaw).

• You mentioned private aircraft, like Cessnas, may be of interest.

• You mused aloud about variations in the optical shadow of the CAD models.

• You told a story about radar being able to resolve the hangar door on an aircraft carrier at HF.

• You discussed convolution kernels for smoothing scintillations at higher radar frequencies.

• We discussed the benefits of having you walk through our bay and provide perturbative guidance. This is a quarantine casualty.
