Dan,

 

You’ve shown the analysis for the azimuth dependency, but I’d like to see the same fourier analysis done with the frequency dependence. 

I’m looking for 10 degree azimuth slices represented by a function in frequency.  This would be less terms and I recognize some of the azimuth features would be lost by collapsing 10 degrees of azimuth structure into one value
