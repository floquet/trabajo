RCS status

Start with progress on two high-priority items

1. Creating a boat
    No boat yet
    There are boat tutorials on line, but they are overly detailed, or historical models (wooden ships)
    Effort was made to find a *.stl file (CAD model); man exist, but behind pay walls
    Currently working on a super simple CAD model - does not look military

2. 3D data
    3D has been run and plotted - we are looking for the overhead view which
        lights up the fuselage and wings simultaneously
    Scripts are being used
    A set of simple tools have been created to generate scripts
    Version control issues caused a few runs to be rejected
    Episodic anomalies
      For example:
        libc.so.6          00007FAE133C30B3  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown
        MMoM_4.1.12        000000000041D629  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown
        forrtl: error (78): process killed (SIGTERM)
    3D has pushed the limits of manual data analysis
        MoM generates copious output ( GB range)
        MoM can demand copious input
        System is streamlined now with templates
    For example: 360/361 data points
    Working on packing data into HDF5 format with compression
    This will be a common template for use with ABC data

• We have completed a thorough documentation of our work
    •• draft delivered to group on Monday
    •• includes computational prescriptions
    •• catalogs results
    •• cross-references documentation to date
    •• Ye has a carefully-crafted plan for distillation

• We are working on a Python version of the data analysis for you
    •• We expect the script to reflect a streamlined and simplified process
    •• It will start with the CAD file, execute MoM, and present the RCS plots on your desktop

• You mused about the optical cross section (shadow size) in our face-to-face on 4 May
    •• Being intrigued, but time starved, I posed a question on Stack Exchange
    •• Responses vary from 1 to 7 lines of code (= simple)
    •• Question is very popular
    •• Haven't run the codes yet
