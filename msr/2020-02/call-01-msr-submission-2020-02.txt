Call-01 Radar Cross Section
1. Documented problems with MMViz:
    Windows 10 environment (Desktop and virtual enviroment)
    Linux environments: Debian, Fedora, Centos, Scientific Liux, Ubuntu
2. MMViz exercises included Pill Tutorial and AFIT Sphere Tutorial
3. Released two slide decks (rcs-chaska.pdf, rcs-afcap-carbon) documenting methods and results with Sciacca airframe in Mercury MoM 4.1.12
    improved capability to extract complex fields values from ASCII output files
    demonstrated capability to convert Mercury MoM complex field values for vertical and horizontal electric fields into and co- and cross-polarization states
    demonstrated capability to compute mean total radar cross section (RCS)
    demonstrated capability to present plots of showing RCS as a function of nose angle and frequency
    demonstrated capability to extract and plot RCS as a function of frequency
    prepared animation showing RCS for nose angle=[-pi, pi], and then sweeping through frequencies
    modified plot routines to include a legend and display wavelength along with frequency
    spoke with John Schaeffer (author of Mercury MoM) about his code.
4. Developed first cut of algorithm to decompose RCS cross section into Fourier amplitudes.
