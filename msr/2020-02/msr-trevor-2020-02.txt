Dan,

IRI Javascript translation variables are described in the attached document.

Here are a few bullets for STC modeling efforts:

    Recently explored multiple implementations to reduce 3-D model computations - Boris correction, diffusive solutions, etc.
        None of these implementations were appropriate for our modeling requirements
    Currently exploring a reduced (force balanced) model implementation
