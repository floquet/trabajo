Hi Dan

Here are our bullets for the April Call 4 report.

    Performed analysis of magnetic field effects on ray-tracing in the context of the project application. Determined that these effects are significant and need to be included for even reasonable fidelity solutions.
    Presented results to sponsor who concurred with conclusions. The results inform the use of ray tracing codes in the project and suggest that we will continue with PHaRLAP as a tool in Call 04.
    Consulted ERT team on TICS/ALFA implementation in C, particularly on IRI module translation.
    Started integrating components for ALFA python prototype.

If you need anything else just let us know.

Stay safe and healthy
regards,
Dwight
