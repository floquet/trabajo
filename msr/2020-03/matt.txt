What I Did:
Converted QPS C code into JavaScript with unit test showcasing same output and confidence in complete conversion
Converted Homing algorithm with stubbed out ray tracer functionality
Ironed out 11 parameter JSON suite with approval on units and display order and metadata
Created 3D Fan Grid for Ionosphere interpolation
Created new JSON object containing 3D Fan Grid for ray tracer to use
Signed up for DI2E onboarding and account creation
Fixed bugs and added recommendation on coefficient grid dashboard per Nelson's request - This helps test the 11 paramater JSON

Challenges:
Slow JSON generation creates a slow turnaround for approval and completion
Email communication also creates slow turnaround for fixes / updates
Converting C test code output to be useful in JavaScript unit tests

Next month challenges:
Convert entirety of homing algorithm with unit test
Complete cloud placement algorithm working with Trevor
Implement cloud placement in dashboard
