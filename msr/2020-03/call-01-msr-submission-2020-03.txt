        report: phase-1-summary-01 Radar Cross Section: Phase 1 Summary Report
        animation sequence: RCS as function of radar frequency - accumulation of RCS profiles 3-30 MHz, and 30-3 MHz
        animation sequence: RCS as a function of yaw angle - shows profiles for azimuth sweep (-pi, pi)
    Apr 21: delivered to peers
        memo detailing how the MoM sampling mesh destroys the orthogonality of the trigonometric functions
    Apr 29: delivered memo to Nelson comparing the two fit strategies recorded in Apr 20 report
        memo detailing how the MoM sampling mesh destroys the orthogonality of the trigonometric functions
    Apr 30: exchanged spreadsheets with Nelson to refine truncation criteria for Fourier expansions
    Performed analysis on the truncation criteria for the Fourier decompositions
        A. Magnitude of residual errors < 5 sq m at 3 sigma confidence
        B. Magnitude of difference between data and fit < 10 sq m
        C. Magnitude of residual errors < 5 sq m always
    Worked with Chris to develop JavaScript version of a Fourier decomposition for timing measurements.
    Created place-holder Jupyter notebook to hold accumulated Python scripts.
